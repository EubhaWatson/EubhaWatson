# Hello, world.

My name is Valerie and I like to make cool things.

I have fifteen years of experience in illustration and visual communication design. As a freelancer, I worked on all sorts of projects, including graphic novels and web comics, VLT cabinets and games, product packaging, branding, album artwork, work for non-profit organisations, and more.

In 2010, I began making websites. Although I began with just HTML & CSS, I quickly fell in love with programming and returned to school to learn full-stack development.

Currently, I teach digital media and information technology courses at the post-secondary level. Sometimes, this includes things on the front-end (HTML/CSS/JS, UI/UX, design thinking and user-testing), while other times it includes things on the back-end (PHP, Python, SQL, etc.). 

## Fun Facts

- ü§ñ My mum was a databaser and would often bring home printed code to manually review COBOL routines. I loved this because she let me tear off the perforated edges and draw on the back.
- üíº When I was sixteen-years-old, I took a career aptitude test that said I would be best suited as a jeweller, chicken farmer, or a taxidermist.
- üïπÔ∏è I make Skyrim mods in my spare time. Most of them are compatibility patches (or conversions from SE v.1.5.97 to v.1.6.XX).
- ü¶∏ Although I've been on quite a few comics projects, none of them have ever been in the superheo genre.
